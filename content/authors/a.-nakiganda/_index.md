I am currently a PhD student at [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/). My research simultaneously looks into the operational and investment planning and optimisation of microgrid networks and the dynamical nature of their inherent systems to ensure a secure, reliable and resilient performance in different modes operation.
