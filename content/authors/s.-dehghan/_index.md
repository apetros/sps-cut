I have conducted multidisciplinary research on smart power and energy systems intending to make future energy networks more sustainable, resilient, reliable, and cost-effective under static and dynamic techno-economic constraints. This includes the design of data-driven tools for the operation, control, and planning in transmission and distribution networks and microgrids, with a specific focus upon the integration of electric vehicles and renewable sources. I also undertake research on energy economics and electricity markets with an emphasis on consumer-centric business models. In addition, my research has resulted in a series of state-of-the-art non-deterministic mathematical algorithms for the adequacy and security assessment of the electrical power system.
