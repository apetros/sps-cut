The Cyprus University of Technology (CUT), in collaboration with RTE France, is recruiting for a 4-year fully-funded Ph.D. position on the topic of open-source numerical methods for power system simulations.

## About the project

Electricity companies rely heavily on time-domain numerical simulations of differential-algebraic equations (representing the electricity grid), to plan future developments, assess new technologies and operational strategies, or check the security of the system. 

However, electric power systems are evolving with new Smart Grid technologies, spearheaded by the introduction of renewables, communication-based monitoring and operation, and digital controls. These changes introduce challenges in the existing numerical methods used for time-domain simulation, with smaller dynamics time-constants, communication delays, and asynchronous (sometimes black box) digital controllers introducing discrete changes to the system equations.

The aim of this Ph.D. project is i) to identify the impact of digital controllers and other smart grid technologies on the performance and accuracy of numerical simulations of power systems, ii) to propose new or improve existing numerical methods to resolve the issues identified, and iii) show the performance through an open-source prototype implementation.

The candidate will be located at CUT under the supervision of Dr. {{% mention "p.-aristidou" %}} but is expected to closely collaborate and visit the industrial and academic partners at RTE France (Adrien Guironnet and Patrick Panciatici), the University of Manchester ([Prof. Stefan Guettel](http://guettel.com)), and Technical University of Hamburg ([Prof. Daniel Ruprecht](https://www.mat.tuhh.de/home/druprecht_en)).

## About the candidate

The position is open for national, EU, and international candidates. The ideal candidate must have: 

- A Masters degree in applied mathematics, electrical engineering, control engineering, computational mathematics, or a related field
- A strong background in numerical analysis
- A strong background in programming (C, C++, Python, Fortran, etc.) 
- Excellent knowledge of English language (written and spoken)
- Prior research experience or specialization in numerical analysis, ideally in numerical methods for time-dependent differential equations, will be considered an advantage
- Prior knowledge in electric power system modeling will be considered an advantage
