I recently attended the Grid-Forming Control Workshop, organized by the renowned L2EP (Laboratoire d'Électrotechnique et d'Électronique de Puissance de Lille), a leading research laboratory dedicated to advancements in power electronics and electrotechnics. Held from July 8–11, 2024, this summer school was an extraordinary opportunity to deepen my understanding of grid-forming control and its practical applications in modern power systems.

## Key Highlights of the Workshop

1. **Foundational Insights:** The workshop began with an engaging session on grid-following control theory and simulation after a warm welcome and introduction. This set the groundwork for the rest of the workshop by exploring how grid-following mechanisms interact with grid-forming controls to maintain system stability.

2. **Applications and Stability:** The sessions covered the design and theoretical analysis of grid-forming control, its applications to modular multilevel converters (MMC) and voltage source converters (VSC), and strategies for enhancing stability under large disturbances. Through a mix of lectures and simulations, participants gained practical insights into addressing real-world challenges.

3. **Converter Integration:** The focus then shifted to converter interactions within the grid, delving into the dynamics between synchronous machines and power converters. The highlight of the day was a practical demonstration of grid-forming control, offering participants a glimpse into its transformative potential.

4. **AC/DC Grid Interaction:** The workshop concluded with an exploration of the interaction between AC and DC grids and a final discussion on the future of grid-forming control technologies. This session emphasized the growing need for integrated approaches in managing diverse energy resources effectively.
