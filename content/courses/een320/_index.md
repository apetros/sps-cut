This course covers the fundamentals of power system modeling, structure, and basic characteristics. It helps the students to understand the functional characteristics and to develop models for component-level as well as system-level analysis. The basic power system components, such as synchronous machines, transmission lines, transformers, and loads, are analyzed and their impact on the system is considered through real-life scenarios. The course focuses on steady-state, symmetrical, and normal (no-fault) operation.
