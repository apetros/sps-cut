This course intends to provide you with a fundamental understanding of the key equipment and their functionality in electric power systems.

You should register to the [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3ae6aee6ea4e34493892e6169e3ec8b28e%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=9b19c04b-4397-490d-8a7b-6376e3c1d0a7&tenantId=8f7698bc-b1b4-439f-b259-0213401d1cfb) of the course since a lot of the teaching happens there.

## Time and place

**Anymore courses are run online**

- Monday 08:30-10:30, 3rd floor lab (Εργαστήριο Δικτύων και Επιστήμης Δεδομένων)
- Wednesday 10:30-12:30, ΧΩΔ

## Learning outcome

On completion of this module, students should be able to:

- explain the functioning and modelling of the main components in a power system
- understand the principles of planning and operation of power systems
- be able to solve basic load flow calculations
- have an overview of future trends in power systems and smart grids
- appreciate, through basic case studies, the technical challenges in both the design and the operation of power systems
