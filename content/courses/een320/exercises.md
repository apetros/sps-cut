The exercises are *not* mandatory and do not normally contribute to your final score. The exercises will only contribute *positively* to your final grade if you have a marginal score.

You can find the exercises in the [Booklet with exercises](https://www.dropbox.com/s/psj6uvsmp4fq4fl/Exercise_booklet.pdf?dl=0). It gets updated frequently.

You have to upload the exercises in **PDF format** in the links provided. The file name should be your cut.ac.cy email handle. That is, if your email is *j.doe@edu.cut.ac.cy*, then the submitted file should be *j.doe.pdf*.

To scan your solutions to pdf, you can use the university copy machines (this is the proposed way) or your phone. There are many apps available that can scan a document to pdf with you phone camera ([android examples](https://fossbytes.com/best-android-scanner-apps/), [iphone example](https://apps.apple.com/cy/app/camscanner-pdf-scanner-app/id388627783)).
