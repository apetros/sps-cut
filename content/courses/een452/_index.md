## Learning outcome

On completion of this course, students should be able to:

- Describe and analyze the control structures for stable operation of electric power systems;
- Perform system-wide studies to identify and propose solutions for common dynamic problems; and,
- Understand, describe, and analyze the economic and secure operation of electric power systems.

## Prerequisites

The following course knowledge is a prerequisite for this course:

1. Power systems I ([EEN320](https://sps.cut.ac.cy/courses/een320/)) or equivalent
2. Power systems II ([EEN442](https://sps.cut.ac.cy/courses/een442/)) or equivalent

## Syllabus
