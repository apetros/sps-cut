This course extends the into the area of electric power systems based on the courses EEN320 and EEN442. In the first part, it analyzes the dynamic behavior and various control structures. In the second part,  it focuses advanced concepts and operational principles concerning economic and secure operation of electric power systems.

## Learning outcome

On completion of this course, students should be able to:
- Describe and analyze the control structures for stable operation of electric power systems;
- Perform system-wide studies to identify and propose solutions for common dynamic problems; and,
- Understand, describe, and analyze the economic and secure operation of electric power systems.

## Prerequisites

The following course knowledge are prerequisites for this course:
1. Power systems I ([EEN320](https://sps.cut.ac.cy/courses/een320/)) or equivalent
2. Power systems II ([EEN442](https://sps.cut.ac.cy/courses/een442/)) or equivalent

## Syllabus

1. Revision of power engineering fundamentals
1. Synchronous machine (simplified and detailed models)
2. Frequency control (turbine-generation, primary/secondary frequency control, inertia)
3. Voltage control (Volt-Var control, primary voltage control, AVR, shunt devices, tap-changing transformers, FACTS devices)
4. Power system stability (angle/voltage/frequency, small-disturbance, transient stability)
1. Economics of electricity generation (economic dispatch, unit commitment, basic market operations)
