This course extends into the field of electric power systems based on the course EEN320. It focuses on the use of computational methods for the analysis of electric power systems in steady-state as well as during symmetrical and asymmetrical faults. It proceeds to provide the fundamental understanding of protection devices operation and selection.

You should register to Microsoft Teams for the Blended Learning part of the course. At the [course repository](https://github.com/SPS-L/EEN442) you can find the material for the PandaPower part.

## Time and place

- Tuesdays 17:00-21:00 (Amohostos room)
- Thursday 11:00-12:00 (MS Teams)

## Learning outcome

On completion of this course, students should be able to:

- Understand the fundamental computational methods to analyze the steady-state and
under-fault operation of electric power systems;
- Understand and analyze the basic power transfer limits in electric power systems; and,
- Understand the fundamentals of protection devices and protection selection.

## Syllabus

1. Revision of power engineering fundamentals (per-unit,
line/transformer/generator/load models) 
2. Transmission line operation (Surge impedance loading, lossless line,
efficiency, loadability, maximum power over line, P-δ and P-V
characteristics, Ferranti effect)
3. Power flow analysis (nodal admittance matrix, NR-method, fast
decoupled, DC power flow)
4. Unbalanced operation (symmetrical components)
5. Fault analysis (modeling line/transformer/generator during fault, solid
faults)
6. Protection fundamentals (fundamentals, structure, overcurrent, distance,
differential, digital relays)

## Delivery

Due to special circumstances, this year the course is following a blended learning schedule with 2 hours in person + 1 hours online. This might be modified according to the requirements and the regulations.

1. Theory delivered through lectures (in class ≈ 32 hours)
2. Practical examples (in class ≈ 12 hours)
3. Hardware laboratory work (in class ≈ 8 hours)
   a. Three-Phase AC Power Circuits: Connection, system familiarization, Wye-Delta connections, power measurements.
   b. Power Factor Correction: Power factor and power factor correction.
   c. AC / DC Motors and Generators: Connection and familiarization, losses and efficiency.
