This course extends into the field of electric power systems based on the course EEN320. It focuses on the use of computational methods for the analysis of electric power systems in steady-state as well as during symmetrical and asymmetrical faults. It proceeds to provide the fundamental understanding of protection devices operation and selection.

## Learning outcome

On completion of this course, students should be able to:

- Understand the fundamental computational methods to analyze the steady-state and
under-fault operation of electric power systems;
- Understand and analyze the basic power transfer limits in electric power systems; and,
- Understand the fundamentals of protection devices and protection selection.

## Syllabus

1. Revision of power engineering fundamentals (per-unit,
line/transformer/generator/load models) 
2. Fundamentals of power system operation (Surge impedance loading, lossless line,
efficiency, loadability, maximum power over line, P-δ and P-V
characteristics, Ferranti effect)
3. Power flow analysis (nodal admittance matrix, NR-method, fast
decoupled, DC power flow)
4. Unbalanced operation (symmetrical components)
5. Fault analysis (modeling line/transformer/generator during fault, solid
faults)
6. Protection fundamentals (fundamentals, structure, overcurrent, distance,
differential, digital relays)
