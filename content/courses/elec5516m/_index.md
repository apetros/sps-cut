This module introduces students to the concepts behind future sustainable electricity systems with increased penetration of distributed microgenerators.

## Objectives

To provide students with the knowledge and understanding of the issues relating to the integration of distributed generators (including renewable sources), their control and protection methods, and tools to analyse their impact to the grid.

## Learning outcomes

On completion of this module, students should be able to:

- Understand the basic planning and operation aspects of power systems;
- be able to perform basic power flow and fault calculations and analyse the steady state operation of systems with distributed generators;
- be able to analyse basic case studies concerning the integration of distributed generators, understand the technical challenges, and provide solutions;
- be able to use computer tools to analyse the performance of systems with grid-connected microgeneration and make practical demonstrations.


## Syllabus

- Power system structure and operation: Description of power system structure, mathematical modelling of basic components, and analysis techniques. Fundamentals of grid operation, voltage and frequency control;
- Power flow analysis: formulation of the power flow problem (number of equations and variables, bus classification, etc) and popular solution techniques (Newton-Raphson, DC power flow);
- Fault analysis and protection: modelling of networks under fault, symmetrical fault calculations, asymmetrical fault calculations, basic protection techniques (voltage, frequency, islanding, etc.);
- Intelligent solutions for power quality correction and power flow control: FACTS devices, control of distributed generators through ICT.
