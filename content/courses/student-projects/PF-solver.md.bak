## Background

Modern [Smart Grids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_grid) rely on advanced computational tools to provide valuable information to the network operators. One of the most important tools used to ensure the security of Smart Grids are [power flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_system_simulation#Load_flow_calculation). They analyse the behaviour of Smart Grid models in time after a disturbance has occurred (loss of generation, lightning hitting a line, etc.). These computational tools have been around for decades and are considered one of the most important tools in electric energy systems.

## Objectives

In this project, you are called upon to bring one such power flow solver to the 21st century. You will need to implement a three-phase parallel power flow simulator (see [ARTERE](http://www.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/~vct/software.html) for example) in Python, using high performance numerical libraries.

## Deliverables

- A complete literature review including a comparison between different existing power flow solvers.
- An implementation of Python power-flow solver with accelerations.
- All the code developed should be documented and published on [GitHub](https://github.com/) under an MIT License[^GitHubLIC].

## Student profile

- Good analytical skills (Newton-type solution methods).
- Good programming skills (Python or Julia or willingness to learn fast).
- Background in electric power systems (minimum [Power Systems I]({{< ref "/courses/een320/_index.md">}})).
