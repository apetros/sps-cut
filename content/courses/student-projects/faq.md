#### Q: Can I propose my own project?

Of course, as long as it is within my interests and that you provide a serious project description. The description should include the background, project objectives and deliverables, and a few relevant references.

#### Q: You mentioned X as a desirable skill but I'm not good at it. Can I still get the project?

Sure, if you believe you can get up to speed fast with the required skill.

#### Q: How can I handle my references?

I would suggest to use [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/). It's a free tool to manage your papers and add references to your report.

#### Q: How to manage my project?

I strongly suggest to use [Trello](https://trello.com). It's a free tool for tracking your progress and doing project management. If you use this, add me to the Board so I can give you more immediate feedback.
