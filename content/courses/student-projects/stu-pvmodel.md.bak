## Background

Modern [Smart Grids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_grid) rely on advanced computational tools to analyse the security of the system and provide valuable information to the network operators. However, the results are only as good as the models used to represent the Smart Grid components in these computational tools. As sustainable energy resources are increasing in number and capacity, it becomes more and more important to develop accurate and validated models to represent these units in the computational tools used to analyse the security of Smart Grids. These models are usually represented using block-diagrams or systems of differential-algebraic equations[^kundur].


## Objectives

In this project, you have to develop and validate a dynamic model of the well-known WECC Photovoltaic generator model[^WECCPV] to be used in dynamic simulations for assessing the security of Smart Grids and the impact of renewable generators.

## Deliverables

- A complete literature review including a comparison between different existing PV dynamic models.
- A PV generator model implemented in RAMSES[^RAMSES] and validated against measurements from WECC[^WECCVAL].
- A PV generator model implemented in MATLAB simulink and validated against measurements from WECC[^WECCPV2] using the Smart Grid Laboratory.
- All the code developed should be documented and published on [GitHub](https://github.com/) under an MIT License[^GitHubLIC]. The final code (along with all other supplementary files) should be published on [Zenodo](http://www.zenodo.org/) and the DOI included in the final report[^ZenDOI].

## Student profile

- Good analytical skills.
- Background in renewable energy sources.
