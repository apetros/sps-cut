## Background

Electrification of transportation[^EV] is one of the main drivers for carbon reduction in modern societies. Most countries today are providing incentives for the replacement of conventional ICE cars with electric or hybrid ones.

These cars will be hosted in the existing Distribution Networks (DNs) and might cause severe issues related to congestion and power quality. If these problems are not analysed and addressed, the penetration of EVs will be hindered and delayed.

## Objectives

In this project, you have to analyse the impact of EVs on an unbalanced distribution network with increased penetration of renewables[^R1]. This will involve understanding the structure of DNs and their limitations, modeling of different power components, and analysing power quality issues. Moreover, you will need analyse the impact of different combinations through a stochastic method to account for uncertainty. Some references are [^P1] and [^P2].

This project requires excellent *programming* and *analytical* skills. It is in collaboration with [EAC](http:/www.eac.com.cy).

## Deliverables

- A complete literature review for methodologies to assess the impact of passive EVs to unbalanced DNs with increased penetration of renewables.
- Model a three-phase, low-voltage, representative Cypriot DN system in Pandapower.
- Develop a feeder load modeling estimation algorithm.
- Develop a feeder PV modeling estimation algorithm.
- Develop a method to assess impact of EVs on the power quality of DNs.

## Student profile

- Good analytical skills (eigenanalysis, linear algebra, system modelling, etc.).
- Good programming skills (Python or willingness to learn fast).
- Background in electric power systems (minimum [Power Systems I]({{< ref "/courses/een320/_index.md">}})).
