## Background

The high penetration of RES in Modern [Smart Grids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_grid) leads to the decommissioning of synchronous generators that traditionally provided the necessary support to ensure the security and stability of power systems. Thus, the resulting power systems exhibit a wide range of security and stability problems, labeled as "low-inertia" problems [^lowinertia]. It is imperative to analyze these problems, using dynamic system models and future energy scenarios, and to develop solutions that will mitigate the impact.

## Objectives

In this project, you have to translate the dynamic model of the Cyprus into the dynamic simulator PyRAMSES[^PyRAMSES]. Following, an analysis will be performed using different future energy scenarios and solutions will be provided to enhance the stability of the Cyprus system.

## Deliverables

- A complete literature review on the problems of future low-inertia grids, like the Cyprus system[^lowinertia].
- A Python-based translator from DigSilent PowerFactory format to PyRAMSES[^PyRAMSES]. This translator will be used to generate the Cyprus dynamic system in PyRAMSES format.
- An analysis of the system behaviour (transient behaviour to disturbances, load variation, etc.)
- Proposed solutions based on storage or artificial inertia.

## Student profile

- Good analytical skills.
- Good programming skills (Python or willingness to learn fast).
- Background in electric power systems (minimum [Power Systems I]({{< ref "/courses/een320/_index.md">}})).
