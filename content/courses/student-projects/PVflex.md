## Background

The rapid increase in the penetration of RES is creating many problems to electric power systems, especially low-inertia, islanded grids [^p1]. In periods of high PV penetration, the Cyprus system needs to curtail power generation from residential PV systems to ensure the security of the system and avoid congestion [^p2]. This action leads to waste of renewable energy, loss of revenue for the residential customers, higher household electricity prices.

The main issues contributing to this problem are:

- *Lack of proper monitoring on residential PV systems*: This leads to inaccurate PV generation estimations, higher uncertainty, and higher RES curtailments.
- *Lack of controllability in small PV installations*: Inability of the system operators to control and disconnect PV systems at a lower granularity level.

## Objectives

In this project, you have to develop a low-cost residential PV monitoring and control system that will provide better data for forecasting and control and allow the system operators to disconnect and reconnect small PV systems.

## Deliverables

- A complete literature and market review including a comparison between different existing technologies for monitoring and control of rooftop PV systems.
- A complete design of an affordable PV monitoring and control device.
- A working prototype of a PV monitoring and control device.
- An centralized server-based solution for collecting and analyzing the software.

## Student profile

- Good programming skills (microcontrollers, python, C/C++).
- Some electronics design background.
- Some signals processing and filtering background.
- Good background in electric power systems (minimum [Power Systems I]({{< ref "/courses/een320/_index.md">}})).
