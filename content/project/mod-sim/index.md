## Summary

As power systems are becoming more complex and large, so are the requirements for advanced computational tools that bring together numerical analysis, power system modeling, and computational techniques to allow for faster or real-time analysis of the system. 

In this research theme, you will find work undertaken by our lab in collaboration with many other institutes to in designing and building such tools.
