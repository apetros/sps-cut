## Summary

The DN DENSE is addressing individual research projects and training of early-stage researchers (ESRs) in the innovative dependable 
engineering of Smart Energy Systems (SESs) with the main focus on robustness as well as preventive and corrective actions under 
uncertainty. 

Within this concept, the term “Smart Energy Systems (SESs)” refers to a holistic cross-sectoral approach (e.g. electricity, heating, 
cooling, industry, buildings and transportation) aimed at excelling the transformation towards sustainable and achievable future energy 
systems. Hence, it both covers but also extends beyond the Smart Grid approach, which is mainly focused on the electricity sector. 
Consequently, SESs exhibit the following attributes: 

- Complex interactions on sub-system and cross-sectoral systems-of-systems levels; 
- Cyber-physical characteristics with digital and physical network connections; 
- Ability to operate in non-stationary, uncertain and severe environments. 

Dependability of complex networks, such as SESs, characterizes their ability to deliver service that can justifiably be trusted. Thus, 
dependability comprises system attributes, such as availability, reliability, safety, integrity and maintainability. A key requirement of 
dependability is the desire for providing justifiable trust in the system performance. Hence, rigorous systems engineering yielding 
provable performance guarantees throughout the system’s life time is already required at the design stage. This challenge is tackled 
in DENSE with a focus on operational robustness as well as preventive and corrective actions in SESs. As a consequence, DENSE is 
well-aligned with the EU Commission’s headline ambitions on the European Green Deal as well as the strive for grasping the 
opportunities from the digital age, while increasing social fairness and prosperity.
