## Summary

The growing integration of renewable energy sources is compelling power system operators to decommission conventional power plants, resulting in a loss of inertia and frequency control capabilities. This shift has led the system to operate at marginal or even lower limits of frequency reserves, diminishing overall reliability. Consequently, there is a critical need to resize reserves using innovative techniques and explore new frequency reserve products to mitigate these challenges. This project focuses on the dimensional aspects of Inertia, FFR (Frequency-Frequency Response), FCR (Frequency-Containment Reserve), FRR (Frequency Restoration Reserve), and RR (Restorarion Reserve) to address and optimize the system's response

## Methodology

The methodologies that were used in the current project focus on theoretical calculation of system limits, dynamic simulations, probabilistic techniques, and machine learning.
