## Summary

Can a bunch of non-homogeneous Distributed Energy Resources be made to behave a single entity? Can we operate this entity in an optimal way?

In this project we investigate the technical challenges relating to the creation of a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) through a cyber-physical layer of control and communication.
