## Summary

This project will tackle the lack of engineering expertise and knowledge in the local workforce in Tanzania by establishing the Renewable Energy Technology Centre (RETC). The institute will design and implement a sustainable energy education and capacity building programme that will directly benefit students, academic staff and renewable energy industry at a local and regional level. The centre will provide graduates with the necessary skills and knowledge to start their own business (SME) or be employed immediately by industry.
