## Summary

Remote rural and islanded communities face many difficulties in adequate and secure energy supply. In many cases, connecting these communities to the bulk electricity grid is economically challenging or impossible due to geographical constraints. Climate change and reliance on fossil fuels make the
electrification of these communities more complicated. In this project, we work with the Alderney Electricity Ltd (AEL) on the existing microgrid in Alderney as ​the 3rd largest of the Channel Islands to investigate reinforcement and investment solutions ​increasing its resilience and sustainability through employing and extending​ ​the microgrid planning tools developed by our group.

## Methodology

In this project we are extending the planning tool PyEPLAN currently developed by our group to investigate solutions for developing a resilient and sustainable energy system with low carbon emissions.
