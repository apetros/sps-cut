abstract = "A formulation is proposed in which an AC-DC system is modeled as a combination of AC grids, DC grids, injectors, AC two-ports and AC/DC converters, respectively. This modular modelling facilitates the dynamic simulation of future complex AC/DC systems. Furthermore, it can be exploited by the solver, which performs less operations on components with lower dynamic activity, and offers parallel processing of the time simulation. This approach is illustrated on a test system in which a multi-terminal DC grid connects two asynchronous AC systems, allows frequency support between them, and acts as emergency control against AC voltage instability."
