abstract = "This paper deals with a new scheme for coupling phasor-mode and electromagnetic transients simulations. In each simulation, an iteratively updated linear equivalent is used to represent the effect of the subsystem treated by the other simulation. Time interpolation and phasor extraction methods adapted to this scheme are presented and compared to existing methods. Finally, simulation results obtained with a 74-bus test system are reported."
