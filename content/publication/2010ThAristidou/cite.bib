 abstract = {Game theory is a branch of applied mathematics that is, most notably, used in economics as well as in engineering and other disciplines. Game theory attempts to mathematically capture behaviour in strategic situations, in which an individual’s success in making choices depends on the choices of others. The microgrid encompasses a portion of an electric power distribution system that is located downstream of the distribution substation, and it includes a variety of DER units and different types of end users of electricity and/or heat. Microgrids promote the use of new technologies, under the general Smart Grids’ umbrella, in order to achieve more efficient use of electric energy, better protection, improved control and provide services to the users. For the materialization of the infrastructure needed to implement this model, engineers have nominated technologies like smart agents, distributed computing, smart sensors and others, as well as, a solid and fast communication infrastructure. In this decentralized environment, multiple decision making participants interact, each striving to optimize its own objectives. Thus, a game theoretic approach is attempted to model and analyse the strategic situations arising from the interactions.},
