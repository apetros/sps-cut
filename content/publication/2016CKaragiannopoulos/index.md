abstract = "In this paper, a new planning methodology is proposed for existing distribution grids, considering both passive and active network measures. The method is designed to be tractable for large grids of any type, e.g., meshed or radial. It can be used as a decision-making tool by distribution system operators which need to decide whether to invest in new hardware, such as new lines and transformers, or to initiate control measures influencing the operational costs. In this paper, active power curtailment and reactive power control are taken into account as measures to prevent unacceptable voltage rises as well as element overloads, as these allow postponing network investments. A low-voltage, meshed grid with 27 nodes is used to demonstrate the proposed scheme. In this particular case, the results show that by using control measures, an active DSO can defer investments and operate the existing infrastructure more efficiently. The methodology is able to account for variations in operational and investment costs coming from regulatory influences to provide an insight to the most cost-efficient decision."
