abstract = "This paper deals with the impact of time delays on small-signal stability of power systems with an all converter-interfaced generation. For this purpose, a delay differential algebraic equation model of the voltage source converter and its control scheme is developed. The regulation is based on replicating the dynamical properties of a synchronous machine through appropriate controller configuration. Therefore, a virtual inertia emulation is included in the active power control loop. A transcedental nature of the characteristic equation is resolved by implementing the Chebyshev's discretization method and observing a finite number of critical, low-frequency eigenvalues. Based on the proposed approach, a critical measurement delay is evaluated. Furthermore, a bifurcation analysis of the droop gains and inertia constant is conducted. Stability regions and optimal parametrization of the voltage source converter controls are evaluated and discussed."
