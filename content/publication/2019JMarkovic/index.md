abstract = "This paper presents a novel virtual synchronous machine controller for converters in power systems with a high share of renewable resources. Using a linear quadratic regulator-based optimization technique, the optimal state feedback gain is determined to adaptively adjust the emulated inertia and damping constants according to the frequency disturbance in the system, while simultaneously preserving a tradeoff between the critical frequency limits and the required control effort. Two control designs are presented and compared against the open-loop model. The proposed controllers are integrated into a state-of-the-art converter control scheme and verified through electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations."
