abstract = "Co-simulation opens new opportunities to combine mature electromagnetic transients (EMT) and phasor-mode (PM) solvers, and takes advantage of their respective high accuracy and execution speed. In this paper, a relaxation approach is presented, iterating between an EMT and a PM solver. This entails interpolating over time the phasors of the PM simulation, extracting phasors from the time evolutions of the EMT simulation, and representing each subsystem with a proper multiport equivalent when simulating the other subsystem. Various equivalents are reviewed and compared in terms of convergence of the PM-EMT iterations. The paper also considers the update with frequency of the The√å?venin impedances involved in the EMT simulation, the possibility to compute the EMT solution only once per time step, and the acceleration of convergence through a prediction over time of the boundary variables. Results are presented on a 74-bus, 23-machine test system, split into one EMT and one PM subsystem with several interface buses."
