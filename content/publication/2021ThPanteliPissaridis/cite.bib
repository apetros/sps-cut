 abstract = {The future of the automotive industry is focused on electric vehicles (EV) and generally at electrification of transportation. Most countries provide incentives so that the internal combustion engine vehicles to be replaced with electric ones. Therefore, the electric networks of each country, whose transmission and distribution network architectures are still focused on the traditional design and operation, it will be necessary to provide appropriate solutions to the problems that may arise through the increasing penetration of EVs into the power grid. The work presents a comprehensive electric vehicle modeling in order to analyse their sensitivity on the impact on the distribution grid. This stochastic modeling is explained through the application of Monte-Carlo simulations. The analysis takes into account driving profiles of EV owners, type of vehicle (battery capacity, energy consumption), travelling distance, road conditions and approximates the hourly distribution of energy requirements based on different EV charging strategies. The analysis shows that the number of electric vehicles and the charging power greatly affect the power flow simulations results. Effects from the charging behaviour and the type of electric vehicle are observed as well, but to a lesser extent. The control techniques which aim both to shift the peak load and to reduce it, are set to be more beneficial to the grid.},
