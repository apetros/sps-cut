 abstract = {This paper presents a novel strategy for the synchronization of grid-following Voltage Source Converters (VSCs) in power systems with low rotational inertia. The proposed synchronization unit is based on emulating the physical properties of an induction machine and capitalizes on its inherent grid-friendly properties such as self-synchronization, oscillation damping, and standalone capabilities. To this end, the mathematical model of an induction machine is analyzed and reformulated to obtain the unknown grid frequency by processing the voltage and current measurements at the converter output. This eliminates the need for a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) unit, traditionally employed in grid-following VSC control schemes, while simultaneously preserving the system- and device-level control. Furthermore, we provide the appropriate steps for obtaining an index-1 DAE representation of the induction-machine-based synchronization unit, suitable for stability analysis. Our analysis shows that replacing the PLL unit with the virtual induction machine-based synchronization may considerably improve the stability of systems with grid-following converters and facilitate the frequency containment. Furthermore, we validate the performance of the proposed synchronization unit through simulations and provide recommendations for its tuning.},
