 abstract = {This Technical Brochure provides a guidance on inverter-based generator models with associated functions that should be used for specific phenomena such as frequency deviation, large voltage deviation and long-term voltage deviation. This guideline helps to reduce the computational burden when performing simulations as well as to represent more accurate power system dynamic behaviour with inverter-based generators following faults.},
