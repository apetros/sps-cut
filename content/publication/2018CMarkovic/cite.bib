 abstract = {This paper deals with the small-signal stability analysis of converter control modes in low-inertia power systems. For this purpose, a detailed differential-algebraic equation model of the voltage source converter and its control scheme is developed. Both grid-forming and grid-feeding concepts have been considered, as well as different active power controllers based on traditional droop and virtual inertia emulation. An eigenvalue analysis of the linearized state-space system is conducted and the performance of different control configurations is compared. Furthermore, various bifurcation studies have been completed and conclusions on stability margins have been drawn with respect to control sensitivity and robustness.},
