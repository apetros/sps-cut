 abstract = {In this paper, a distributed model-free control scheme to mitigate overvoltage problems caused by high photovoltaic generation in low-voltage feeders is proposed. The distributed controllers are implemented on the photovoltaic inverters and modulate the active and reactive power injected into the network. In particular, they direct photovoltaic units first to consume reactive power and, if necessary, curtail active power generation to reduce high voltages in the feeder.},
