abstract = "Due to the push for more sustainable generation, small-scale distributed energy resources (DERs) penetration has increased significantly. Most countries have no remote monitoring and control requirements for DERs below a certain size. Therefore, they can be labeled as uncontrollable DERs (UDERs). In isolated systems, the UDERs hosting capacity is limited due to frequency stability concerns, as it is impossible to modify or curtail their generation in a centralized manner. In this paper, we propose the utilization of the active power over-frequency reduction curve for increasing the hosting capacity of UDERs in isolated power systems. Cyprus’s power system has been used to evaluate the proposed solution’s performance. The optimal settings of the curve have been identified, and it was found that UDERs hosting capacity can be increased significantly with the proposed methodology."
