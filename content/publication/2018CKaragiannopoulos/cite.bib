 abstract = {Traditional distribution network operators are gradually being transformed to system operators, using modern technologies to ensure a secure and efficient operation in a rapidly changing and uncertain environment. One of their most challenging tasks is to tackle the unbalanced operation of low-voltage networks, traditionally caused by unequal loading and structural asymmetries, and exacerbated by the increased penetration of single-phase distributed energy resources. This paper proposes a centralized operation scheme based on a multi-period optimal power flow algorithm used to compute optimal set-points of the controllable distributed energy resources located in the system. The algorithm reduces the operational cost while satisfying the appropriate security and power quality constraints. Furthermore, the computational tractability of the algorithm and the incremental cost of tackling imbalances in the network are addressed. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is tested on an unbalanced low-voltage distribution network.},
